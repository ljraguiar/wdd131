                        My name is Lucas Aguiar, I'm 26 years old and I live in Recife, Brazil. I'm currently studying Software Development at Brigham Young University 
                        and Computer Science at the Catholic University of Pernambuco. I'm also an online English instructor. 
                        I love watching quality movies at the cinema, dancing and doing physical activities outdoors.

                        Pernambuco is the seventh most populous federal unit in Brazil and has the eleventh highest GDP in the country and the highest GDP per capita 
                        among the Northeastern states. The state has 184 municipalities, as well as the state district of Fernando de Noronha.

                        The capital of Pernambuco, Recife, was founded in 1537 and is the oldest capital in Brazil.

                        The flag of the state of Pernambuco is the same one used by the insurgents of the 1817 Revolution.

                        The Pernambuco Carnival block “Galo da Madrugada” is considered the largest Carnival block in the world by the Guinness Book. 

                        The Ricardo Brennand Institute in Recife houses one of the largest collections of bladed weapons in the world, with more than 3,000 pieces. 

                        The first synagogue in the Americas was established in Recife in 1630. 

                        Olinda was the second Brazilian city to be declared a World Heritage Site in 1982. 

                        Pernambuco wood was of such superior quality that it commanded a premium in European trade. 

                        The first known sugar mill in Portuguese America was built on the Pernambuco coast in 1516.
